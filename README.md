                                                                              Chen Jiang(Fudan)

Abstract: We show that the Q-Fano index of a canonical weak Fano 3-fold is at most 66. This upper bound is optimal and gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Chengxi Wang in dimension 3. During the proof, we establish a new Riemmann--Roch formula for canonical 3-folds and provide a detailed study of non-isolated singularities on canonical Fano 3-folds, concerning both their local and global properties. Our proof also involves a Kawamata--Miyaoka type inequality and geometry of foliations of rank 2 on canonical Fano 3-folds. This is a joint work with Haidong Liu.

                                                                              Yongnam Lee(IBS)

Abstract: In the 1970s, Kunev constructed certain minimal surfaces of general type satisfying p_g = K^2 = 1, which gave a counterexample to the local Torelli theorem. Then Todorov, and Catanese independently, gave a description of all minimal surfaces of general type with p_g = K^2 = 1: the canonical model of such a surface is a weighted complete intersection of bidegree (6, 6) in the weighted projective space P(1, 2, 2, 3, 3). In particular, these surfaces can be viewed as degree 4 covers of the projective plane. The case in which this cover is Galois, recovers Kunev’s example, i.e. Kunev surfaces are bi-double cover of projective plane branched over two general cubics and a line.

Recently, Kerr and Laza classified K3 tails which comes from the isolated quasi-homogeneous hypersurface singularities. In the pure tail case, these are exactly the 14 Dolgachev singularities (exceptional unimodal singularities), the 6 quadrilateral singularities, and 2 trimodal singularities. 

Motivated by Kerr-Laza’s classification and recent work by Gallardo, Pearlstein, Schaffler and Zhang on the construction of specific boundary divisors in KSBA moduli space of I-surfaces which come from the exceptional unimodal singularities, we study specific boundary divisors in KSBA moduli of Kunev surfaces which come from K3 tails corresponding KSBA stable limits. In this talk, we focus on two type of singularities which are double coverer of Z_{12} and W_{15}singularities. Both are codimension 2 weighted K3 surfaces (No. 42 and 13 in Iano-Fletcher’s list). This work is in progress with Luca Schaffler.

                                                                           Sho Tanimoto(Nagoya)
                                                                           
Abstract: Motivated by a topological proof of Manin’s conjecture over global function fields, Ellenberg and Venkatesh envisioned homological stability for the space of sections of Fano fibrations. In this talk we discuss this property in the context of weak approximation and establish such a stability for certain Fano fibrations. This is joint work with Yuri Tschinkel.

                  


                                Poincaré polynomials of moduli spaces of 1-dimensional sheaves on the projective plane

                                                        Longting Wu(Sustech)
                
Abstract: The geometry of moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on the projective plane has attracted a lot of study recently. In this talk, I will give a new calculation of the Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on the projective plane using Gromov-Witten invariants of local P^2 and local curves. The new calculation is based on the refined sheaves/GW correspondence established by Bousseau and all genus local/relative correspondence given by Bousseau-Fan-Guo-Wu. It can be used to prove the divisibility property of Poincaré polynomials of moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on projective plane conjectured by Choi-van Garrel-Katz-Takahashi, and can also be used to determine the leading Betti numbers. Some conjectures concerning the higher range Betti numbers will be proposed if time permits. This is based on a joint work with Shuai Guo and Miguel Moreira.
